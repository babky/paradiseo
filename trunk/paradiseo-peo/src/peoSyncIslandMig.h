//! Class providing the basis for the synchronous island migration model.

//! The peoSyncIslandMig class offers the elementary basis for implementating a
//! synchronous island migration model - requires the specification of several basic
//! parameters, i.e. frequency of the migrations, selection and replacement strategies,
//! a topological model and the source and destination population for the migrating individuals.
//! The main difference as opposed to the asynchronous migration model is the synchronization step
//! performed after selecting and sending the emigrant individuals.
//!
//! The migration operator is called at the end of each generation of an evolutionary algorithms
//! as a checkpoint object - the following code exposes the structure of a classic evolutionary algorithm:
//!
//!	<table style="border:none; border-spacing:0px;text-align:left; vertical-align:top; font-size:8pt;" border="0">
//!	<tr><td><b>do</b> { &nbsp;</td> <td> &nbsp; </td></tr>
//!	<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; select( population, offsprings ); &nbsp;</td> <td>// select the offsprings from the current population</td></tr>
//!	<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; transform( offsprings ); &nbsp;</td> <td>// crossover and mutation operators are applied on the selected offsprings</td></tr>
//!	<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; evaluate( offsprings ); &nbsp;</td> <td>// evaluation step of the resulting offspring</td></tr>
//!	<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; replace( population, offsprings ); &nbsp;</td> <td>// replace the individuals in the current population whith individuals from the offspring population, according to a specified replacement strategy</td></tr>
//!	<tr><td>} <b>while</b> ( eaCheckpointContinue( population ) ); &nbsp;</td> <td>// checkpoint operators are applied on the current population, including the migration operator, if any specified </td></tr>
//!	</table>
//!
//! Constructing a synchronous island migration model requires having defined (1) a topological migration model,
//! (2) the control parameters of the migration process, (3) a checkpoint object associated with an evolutionary algorithm,
//! and (4) an owner object must be set. The owner object must be derived from the <b>Runner</b> class (for example
//! a peoEA object represents a possible owner).
//! A simple example is offered bellow:
//!
//!	<ol>
//!		<li> topological model to be followed when performing migrations: <br/>
//!		<br/>
//!		<table style="border:none; border-spacing:0px;text-align:left; vertical-align:top; font-size:8pt;" border="0">
//!		<tr><td>RingTopology migTopology; &nbsp;</td> <td>// a simple ring topological model - each island communicates with two other islands</td></tr>
//!		</table>
//!		</li>
//!
//!		<li> the continuation criterion, selection and replacement strategy etc. are defined: <br/>
//!		<br/>
//!		<table style="border:none; border-spacing:0px; font-size:8pt;" border="0">
//!		<tr><td>eoPop< EOT > population( POP_SIZE, popInitializer ); &nbsp;</td> <td>// population of individuals to be used for the evolutionary algorithm</td></tr>
//!		<tr><td> &nbsp; </td> <td> &nbsp; </td></tr>
//!		<tr><td>eoRandomSelect< EOT > migSelectStrategy; &nbsp;</td> <td>// selection strategy - in this case a random selection is applied</td></tr>
//!		<tr><td>eoSelectNumber< EOT > migSelect( migSelectStrategy, MIG_SIZE ); &nbsp;</td> <td>// number of individuals to be selected using the specified strategy</td></tr>
//!		<tr><td>eoPlusReplacement< EOT > migReplace; &nbsp;</td> <td>// immigration strategy - the worse individuals in the destination population are replaced by the immigrant individuals</td></tr>
//!		<tr><td> &nbsp; </td> <td> &nbsp; </td></tr>
//!		<tr><td>peoSyncIslandMig< EOT > syncMigration(
//!			<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MIG_FREQ, migSelect, migReplace, migTopology,
//!			<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; population, population
//!			<br/> ); &nbsp; </td>
//!			<td>// synchronous migration object - the emigrant individuals are selected from the same from population in which the immigrant individuals are being integrated </td></tr>
//!		</table>
//!		</li>
//!
//!		<li> creation of a checkpoint object as part of the definition of an evolutionary algoritm (details of th EA not given as being out of scope): <br/>
//!		<br/>
//!		<table style="border:none; border-spacing:0px;text-align:left; vertical-align:top; font-size:8pt;" border="0">
//!		<tr><td>... &nbsp;</td> <td> &nbsp; </td></tr>
//!		<tr><td>eoGenContinue< EOT > eaCont( NUM_GEN ); &nbsp;</td> <td>// the evolutionary algorithm will stop after NUM_GEN generations</td></tr>
//!		<tr><td>eoCheckPoint< EOT > eaCheckpointContinue( eaCont ); &nbsp;</td> <td>// number of individuals to be selected using the specified strategy</td></tr>
//!		<tr><td>... &nbsp;</td> <td> &nbsp; </td></tr>
//!		<tr><td>eaCheckpointContinue.add( syncMigration ); &nbsp;</td> <td>// adding the migration operator as checkpoint element</td></tr>
//!		<tr><td>... &nbsp;</td> <td> &nbsp; </td></tr>
//!		</table>
//!		</li>
//!
//!		<li> definition of an owner evolutionary algorithm (an object inheriting the <b>Runner</b> class): <br/>
//!		<br/>
//!		<table style="border:none; border-spacing:0px;text-align:left; vertical-align:top; font-size:8pt;" border="0">
//!		<tr><td>peoEA< EOT > eaAlg( eaCheckpointContinue, eaPopEval, eaSelect, eaTransform, eaReplace); &nbsp;</td> <td>// evolutionary algorithm having as checkpoint the eaCheckpointContinue object defined above </td></tr>
//!		<tr><td>syncMigration.setOwner( eaAlg ); &nbsp;</td> <td>// setting the evolutionary algorithm as owner of the migration object </td></tr>
//!		<tr><td>eaAlg( population ); &nbsp;</td> <td>// applying the evolutionary algorithm on a given population </td></tr>
//!		</table>
//!		</li>
//!	</ol>
//!
//! The source and the destination population for the migration object were specified as being the same, in step no. 2,
//! as we are usually interested in selecting the emigrants and integrating the immigrant individuals from and in, respectively, one unique
//! population, iteratively evolved by an evolutionary algorithm. There is no restriction in having two distinct populations
//! as source and destination for the emigrant and immigrant individuals respectively.
//!
//! The above steps only create a synchronous migration object associated to an evolutionary algorithm. The creation of several
//! islands requires the reiteration of the steps 2 through 4 for creating distinct algorithms, with distinct populations and
//! the associated distinctly parametrized migration objects. The interconnecting element is the underlying topology, defined at step 1
//! (the same C++ migTopology object has to be passed as parameter for all the migration objects, in order to interconnect them).
