/** @mainpage Welcome to PARADISEO - CVRP-TW contribution

@section Introduction

The capacitated vehicle routing problem with time windows or CVRP-TW is a combinatorial
optimization problem seeking to service a number of customers with a fleet of vehicles
where the vehicles have a mimited capacity and the delivery locations have time windows
within which the deliveries (or visits) must be made. Often the context is that of
delivering goods located at a central depot to customers who have placed orders for such
goods. Implicit is the goal of minimizing the cost of distributing the goods. Finding the
global minimum for the cost function, except for the smallest instances, is
computationally complex.
